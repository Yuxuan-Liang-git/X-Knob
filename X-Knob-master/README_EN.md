# X-Knob

Last year (2021) while surfing the internet, I came across the [smart_knob(SK)](https://github.com/scottbez1/smartknob) project and was immediately interested. However, after looking into it, I was discouraged by the "expensive" brushless motor that was out of stock üòÖ. 

I recently discovered @45coll and @fywbcchong2's open source [Super_Dial](https://oshwhub.com/45coll/a2fff3c71f5d4de2b899c64b152d3da5), which inspired me to try it out ü§ó. 

The Super_Dial replaces the "expensive motor" used in the original smart_knob project and adopts a straight design, which I personally find more aesthetically pleasing.

In addition, the author of smart_knob mentioned in the project that they plan to use lvgl to design the UI in the future.

> migrate to LVGL, for better display rendering and easy support for menus, etc. Shouldn't require a full 240x240x24b framebuffer in memory, freeing some for wifi, etc.

Coincidentally, I had previously played with X-TRACK, which had an extremely smooth UI. Therefore, this project will be a composite version of Smart Knob + X-Track UI. **So I call it X-Knob.**

Main hardware list:
- 3 PCBs: main control board + driver board + screen board
- 3205 Brushless Direct Current Motor(10 CNY)
- MCU: ESP32-S3 WROOM-1U-N16R8
- Screen: 240x240 round LCD ("GC9A01"), protected by 40.0 mm watch glass
- Magnetic encoder: MT6701CT
- 602535 600mAh Lithium Battery

Features supported by X-KNOB:

- X-TRACK UI framework(based on LVGL)
- 7 Modes: Combinations of BOUND, DETENTS, ENDSTOPS, and more
- **smart-knob UI based on LVGL framework**
- **Surface Dial**
- Press vibration feedback
- Power management
  - **Battery management**, system deep sleep;
  - Latest hardware (V2) supports UPS
- X-Knob can be integrated with **Home Assistant via MQTT to control devices connected to HASS**.

# Get Started

Basic environment:
- VScode + PlatformIO
- arduino-esp32 v2.0.5

1. Basic configuration
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmallPond/X-Knob.git

# Open the Firmware project using PlatformIO
# Rename the src/secrets.h.example file to src/secrets.h
# and modify the relevant configurations: WiFi password, MQTT server, etc.
cp src/secrets.h.example src/secrets.h

# (Optional) Modify MQTT_HOST in the config.h file to your name
# This macro is used to attach to the MQTT Topic
#define MQTT_HOST               "dingmos"      
``` 
2. Compile && Flash && Enjoy
